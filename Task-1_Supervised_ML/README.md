## Data Science and Business Analytics Internship
I am excited to share a recent project on Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning conducted as part of my internship with The Sparks Foundation. in Data Science and Business Analytics Domain. 

### Task 1: Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning
#### Project Overview:
In this project, I worked on predicting student scores based on the number of hours they studied using a simple linear regression model.
#### Key Insights from the analysis:
1. **Model Accuracy:** The linear regression model accurately predicted student scores based on their study hours.
2. **Positive Correlation:** More study hours generally lead to higher scores.
3. **Visualization Skills:** Enhanced ability to visualize data insights through scatter plots and regression lines.
