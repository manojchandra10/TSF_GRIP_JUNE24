# Data Science and Business Analytics Internship at The Sparks Foundation

## Overview
I am thrilled to share my experience as an intern at The Sparks Foundation, where I successfully completed two significant projects in the realm of Data Science and Business Analytics. This internship not only honed my technical skills but also allowed me to contribute to a vibrant community of fellow interns.

## Projects

### Task 1: Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning

#### Project Overview
In this project, I developed a simple linear regression model to predict student scores based on the number of hours they studied.

#### Key Steps and Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Imported the dataset and performed data cleaning using Python.
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the data distribution and relationships.

2. **Model Development**:
   - Implemented a simple linear regression model to predict student scores.
   - Evaluated the model's accuracy and performance.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Created scatter plots and regression lines to visualize the relationship between study hours and scores.

#### Key Insights
- **Model Accuracy**: The linear regression model effectively predicted student scores based on their study hours.
- **Positive Correlation**: Identified a positive correlation between study hours and student scores.
- **Visualization Skills**: Enhanced ability to visualize data insights through scatter plots and regression lines.

### Task 2: Prediction Using Unsupervised Machine Learning

#### Project Overview
In this project, I utilized the Iris dataset to predict the optimal number of clusters using unsupervised learning techniques.

#### Key Steps and Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Imported and cleaned the Iris dataset using Python.
   - Conducted initial exploratory data analysis to understand the data structure and relationships.

2. **Determining the Optimal Number of Clusters**:
   - Used the elbow method and silhouette analysis to identify the best number of clusters.
   - Implemented K-Means clustering to partition the data into meaningful groups.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Created scatter plots to visualize the clustering results.
   - Compared the clusters with the actual Iris species for validation.

#### Key Learnings and Insights
- **Clustering Analysis**: Identified three distinct clusters within the Iris dataset, which corresponded well with the actual species classifications.
- **Visualization Skills**: Improved ability to visualize complex data insights through scatter plots and cluster visualizations.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Gained a deeper understanding of unsupervised machine learning techniques and their practical applications.

## Community Engagement
During my internship, I actively participated in The Sparks Foundation network group on LinkedIn. I conducted 15 peer review evaluations and assisted more than 15 fellow interns with their doubts and queries.

## Conclusion
I am immensely grateful to The Sparks Foundation for this incredible learning opportunity. This internship has significantly enhanced my skills in data science, machine learning, and data visualization. I look forward to applying these skills in future projects and contributing to the field of data science.
